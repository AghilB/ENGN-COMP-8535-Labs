    "4. Clone the project into your local directory - `$ git clone [your url]`\n",
    "5. Open jyputer notebook (if jyputer isn't installed on your system refer to https://jupyter.org/install)\n",
    "6. Change the markdown to include today's date (02 March, 2022)\n",
    "7. Commit your changes - `git add . | git commit -m 'fix date'`\n",
    "8. Push them to your forked GitHub repository - `git push`\n",
